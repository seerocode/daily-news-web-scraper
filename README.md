# daily-news-web-scraper
My first web scraper (using Python 3, please). Very basic version. WIP as of 4/6/2017

## Use

Built for research project to compile data on gun violence in the Bronx and surrounding areas + contributing factors. This web scraper is for personal use and is a learning process. Please fork and use at your own discretion.

## Search Terms
Bronx, Gun

## Notes

This web scraper is built in Python 3 and being used to scrape article links from The Daily News search website. The scraper is needed so my research advisor and I do not have to manually go through articles in the TDN and figure out which one we should use.

## To-Dos (in no certain order)

Whatever has a :construction: emoji is what I am currently working on as of last commit. Also, some of these to-dos are extensions built on top of this scraper.

- [X] Fix up style of code as it's all over the place (flesh out methods, remove redundant code, etc.) | EDIT: Completed 5/13/17
- [X] Extend search to multiple pages (this is half working as pagination goes deeper than 13 pages but it only captures the first 13) |
EDIT: 4/27/17 - Completed
- [ ] Build web interface to type in any search URL from Daily News and return a list of articles from that search
- [X] Iterate on interface to allow for custom search terms to be applied to the Daily News search from the interface and return full list of articles for that search | EDIT: 5/23/17 - Completed
- [ ] :construction: Connect newspaper API to interface with web and display the articles in a readable format
- [ ] Connect list to database to allow user removal of a document from web interface if it does not fit the specified criteria (e.g. article is vague, doesn't relate to gun violence, dupe, etc.)
- [ ] Allow user to add article to database
- [ ] Highlight key words in extracted article text
- [X] Extract titles of articles, dates, and author (from HTML tags) | EDIT: 4/27/17 Completed with the newspaper API
- [ ] :construction: Connect Google Sheets to scraper
- [ ] :construction: Display the article content on web
